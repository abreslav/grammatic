We need:
  equality

Well-formed models:
  - identities are not objects and dod not contain objects
     -- it is sufficient to require that an identity assigned an object does not refer to the object
        that uses it as identity
  - every identity is assigned to only one object
  - every reference refers to an object (within an context)
  - property names are not objects and don't contain objects if they are as collections
  - property names are not duplicated inside one object (trivial)
  - sets do not contain duplicates (trivial)

Context:
  - context(identity) = object with this identity
  - every reference inside the objects is resolved by this context
