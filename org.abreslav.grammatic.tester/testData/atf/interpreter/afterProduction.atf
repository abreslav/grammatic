// It reports wrong attribute to be not set upon reading

// Bug is the following:
//   two variables a and atom refer to the same object -- call of atom
//   a:: assigns result to result1 attribute
//   atom assigns result to atom#
//   after aspect application what atom set overwrites what was previously set by a::
// possible solution: on a:: identify the call and assign the default attribute of this call
//   now a new attribute is always created if atom# is referenced
// another solution: identify a and atom variables. Will not work exactly this way: atom is more than just a
